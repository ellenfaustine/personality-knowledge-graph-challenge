Dear Creative Director,

My name is Aisha Rahman, and I am applying for the UX Designer position at Atelier Interactive. I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of art and technology — how thoughtful design can influence emotion and behavior. At PixelFlow Studio, I redesigned the mobile onboarding flow for a lifestyle app, increasing user retention by 25%.

My approach to design is empathetic and research-driven. I enjoy listening to users, interpreting subtle feedback, and turning those insights into intuitive experiences. I’m imaginative but also data-minded — balancing aesthetics with measurable usability.

I admire Atelier’s bold design philosophy and collaborative culture, and I believe my blend of creativity and analytical thinking will fit well within your team.
