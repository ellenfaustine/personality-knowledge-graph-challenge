Dear Hiring Manager,

My name is Evelyn Tan, and I am writing to express my interest in the Data Analyst position at Nova Insights. I have always enjoyed uncovering patterns in complex datasets and translating them into meaningful business strategies. During my internship at Bright Metrics, I developed Python scripts to automate data cleaning, which improved processing efficiency by 30%.

I’m a naturally curious and detail-oriented person who thrives on solving analytical challenges. My colleagues describe me as patient and methodical, always double-checking results before drawing conclusions. I value collaboration and often seek diverse opinions to strengthen my insights.

I’m excited about Nova’s focus on data-driven innovation and would love to contribute to projects that blend creativity with analytical depth.
